# StockHawk
This is the project 3 of the Udacity's Android developer Nanodegree.

I used the Github repo as a reference:

https://github.com/daniellehrner/stockhawk

I also used the following libraries on my project:

- Dagger (dependency injection) -> http://square.github.io/dagger/
- WilliamChart (to build the graph) -> https://github.com/diogobernardino/WilliamChart
- Otto (to decouple parts of the application) -> http://square.github.io/otto/
